## What I Learned in Class 3

We learned about how you (Ed) envisioned the Enigma Machine in a flowchart. This included the path of data as it was enciphered and deciphered by the program. It also showed the requirements for using the program on the side. One of the things this flowchart covered was the fact that the same module (function, etc) can appear in different locations, because it is not always clear where the best place to put it is.

We also covered how diagrams are a good way of presenting information to the user. However I believe they still lack in the department of explaining how said diagram actually works. In the end, the best way to present information is written explanations that make use of diagrams when necessary.

It was also made clear that standing up makes it easier to pay attention to information being presented (unless you are tired).

Lastly we covered how we will all be using the same enciphering and deciphering method to guarantee that all students will be able to communicate with each other via their own enigma machine. The process will involve the use of prime numbers that along with a certain calculation, will assign the offset of each rotor. Like I stated earlier, the diagram *was* helpful for explaining the enciphering process, but it still left a lot of information out that would make the process much clearer.

### Not Directly Related to the Lecture

Other than what was directly explained in the lecture, I've learned that 8am classes are definitely not something I will ever function well in. I've been getting up early for over 3 weeks now and I'm still suffering from the exhaustion caused by it even on days without class.

I've also tried watching the class video recordings for the first time to remember what we went over and, although they helped jog my memory, the actual lecture was extremely difficult listen to as the audio quality was constantly fading in and out. The closed captions provided by YouTube (which normally do a very decent job, even with accents) did not help much either. Numerous words were mistranslated and others just weren't picked up at all.

These videos are also hard to listen to because of the constant questioning of students which interrupts the flow of information for another pause that's almost always inaudible. Even if the answers were audible, it still pauses and takes time away from the actual lecture. I understand that keeping students paying attention is important but this method is employed so often that it feels like there's very little covered over the duration of the lecture.
