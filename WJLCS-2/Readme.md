## First Impressions of UML

### Pros

Overall UML definitely seems like a useful tool in planning program designs. It's quicker to look over than standard planning notes and is often easier to grasp. Due to the large variety of diagrams available, you're able to display the same system in multiple ways instead of one fixed method that encompasses everything necessary. This allows splitting up information and making it easier to read. Another benefit is that creating diagrams will often give you incite into the development of your program that you may not notice normally, such as almost forgetting that deciphering in the Enigma Machine has to go through the central wheels first before reaching the checkerboard.

### Cons

In my opinion I also see some cons with using UML, the first major one being the large variety of symbols, arrows, signs, etc. and how they interact with the rest of the diagram. Any user can probably get a basic idea of how something works or is implemented by looking at a UML diagram, but there's such a large variety of symbol usage that anyone not familiar with UML will be unaware of their significance. The amount of arrow types alone is tough to grasp and get a hold of.

Another con is that many diagrams are oversimplified to the point that you have to create another diagram just to make one specific thing clear. Class diagrams don't leave any room for documenting specific members, there're only footnotes or attaching a note element. This leaves the designer at a loss for how to best describe important requirements for a method or attribute without taking up large amounts of space with a note element for ever need.

Lastly, although this con is only relevant to me, I still find it important to bring up. UML design is very tedious when dealing with a dominant hand with Focal Dystonia, mouse usage is made difficult with this condition and there isn't really enough hotkeys in place to fully replace mouse functionality with the usage of hotkeys alone. Although excessive typing is also not easy with Focal Dystonia, it's easier to focus on one peripheral for writing than it is using two.

Although these issues are mostly trivial, I still felt they were important to mention as I haven't fully overcome the issues I have with UML, I do still believe that it will be more useful once I acclimate myself to it.
